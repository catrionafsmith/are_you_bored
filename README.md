This is a flask app which makes suggestions on what to do, based on the Bored API!

__Built with:__ Flask, Python, HTML and CSS, plus the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com).

__What I have learned:__ 
I learned how to:
* Use the Bored API
* Change the opacity of a button in CSS
* Deploy an app using PythonAnywhere.com 
* I also learned how to make bulletpoints in markdown!

__Issues faced and how I resolved them:__ 
Initially I found that I had deployed the standard PythonAnywhere flask app, as their app.py file had overwritten my own one. 
Searching on StackOverflow showed me that others had had similar problems and that checking the app.py file and replacing it if necessary should solve the issue.
